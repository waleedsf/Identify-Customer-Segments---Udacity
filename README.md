### This is project-3 from my Machine Learning With Tensorflow - Nanodegree

The goal of this project is using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and KMeans to identify customer segments of the German population that were popular or less popular with a mail-order sales in Germany.

There were two dataset provided first was demographic data (891,211 individuals)for the general population of Germany and the second dataset was demographic data for customers of a mail-order company (191,652 individuals). Both dataset consists of 85 different features.


# Project Overview:
The main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. I used unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company. Prior to applying the machine learning methods, I also assessed and cleaned the data in order to convert the data into a usable form.
